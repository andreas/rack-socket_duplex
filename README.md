# `rack-socket_duplex`

[http://github.com/andreas/rack-socket_duplex]()

## DESCRIPTION

`Rack::SocketDuplex` is Rack middleware that duplexes HTTP traffic to a unix socket. The primary use case is to subsequently forward this traffic to load test a new production environment (see **EXAMPLE** section).

## FEATURES/PROBLEMS

* Fairly low overhead (~5ms on small tests with a `em-proxy` server listening on the unix socket).
* Ignores SSL traffic.
* Converts Rack env to a raw HTTP request. The conversion tries to be accurate, but there might be discrepancies.

## SYNOPSIS

Add `Rack::SocketDuplex` as middleware in your `config.ru` or where appropriate:

    use Rack::SocketDuplex, "/tmp/rack-socket_duplex"

Use `netcat` or `em-proxy` to listen to the traffic, and forward it to a new production environment (load testing) or log it to a file.

To add `Rack::SocketDuplex` to Rails, add the following line to `config/application.rb` or a specific environment (e.g. `config/environments/development.rb`):

    config.middleware.use "Rack::SocketDuplex", "/tmp/rack-socket_duplex"

## EXAMPLE

See `examples/lobster.ru`. Run the example app with the following command:

    rackup lobster.ru -p 3000

Then open 127.0.0.1:3000 in a browser. To observe what's being written on the socket, run the following command:

    nc -klU /tmp/rack-socket_duplex-test

To forward the data other servers efficiently, use `forwarding-proxy` from the examples-folder (requries `em-proxy'):

    forwarding-proxy.rb /tmp/rack-socket_duplex-test example.com

## REQUIREMENTS

* Ruby 1.9
* Optional: `em-proxy`-gem to use `examples/forwarding-proxy`

## INSTALL

Add to bundler

    gem "rack-socket_duplex", git: "https://github.com/andreas/rack-socket_duplex"

or install as gem

    gem install rack-socket_duplex
